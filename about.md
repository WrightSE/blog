I'm a current senior computer science major at Hendrix College in Conway, Ar. I'm set to graduate in May of 2024 and hope to find a job working in the healthcare sector. My biggest goals post-grad will be to continue to work on developing apps on my free time and learn more anout some of my other academic interests like chemistry.
