Thankfully this blog was fairly straight forward to set up. I did have a few errors but they were entirely user caused. Part of the reason that this blog was so easy to set up is because of the tutorial provided [here](https://hendrix-cs.github.io/csci340/labs/jekyll.html) in conjunction with my websystems and databases class.

One of the errors that I encountered that actually got me twice just in the development of this post was that I didn't realize that the indentation of some of the headers was so important. A small and completely dumb mistake that absolutely got me twice in one go. I used a couple of websites to double check myself. One of the ones that I used is the one hosted [here](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/07-links.html) by Common Mark and the other that I used is hosted [here](https://anvilproject.org/guides/content/creating-links) by Anvil Project.
