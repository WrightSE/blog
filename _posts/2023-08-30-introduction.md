Thankfully this blog was fairly straight forward to set up. I did have a few errors but they were entirely user caused. Part of the reason that this blog was so easy to set up is because of the tutorial provided [here](https://hendrix-cs.github.io/csci340/labs/jekyll.html) in conjunction with my websystems and databases class.

Speaking of classes, here are some of the projects I've worked on in the past in other classes:
1. An app for our college communications office
2.  barebones weather app that uses a phone's built in sensors to guess what the weather will look like for the day
3. A bootleg version of connect4 that can be played on two different devices successfully
4. A barebones to-do list that allowed the user to like things to bump them up in hierarchy so they would be displayed at the top of the list at all times. 

One of the major issues that I encountered was a simple error that actually got me twice just in the development of this post. This silly little User error was that I didn't realize that the indentation of some of the headers was so important. A small and completely dumb mistake that absolutely got me twice in one go. Because I was so confused I used a couple of websites to double check myself. One of the ones that I used is the one hosted [here](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/07-links.html) by Common Mark and the other that I used is hosted [here](https://anvilproject.org/guides/content/creating-links) by Anvil Project. Both of these links discussed how to properly use links in markdown.
