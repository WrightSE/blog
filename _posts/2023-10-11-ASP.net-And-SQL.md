Though my main struggles with this tutorial and lab ended up being due to the fact that I was doing it when I was running off of 3 hours of sleep, there were a few parts that legitimately confused me.
One part of the tutorial that was fairly confusing was the setting up of the "@page "{id: int?}"" in the webpages. This one was me just not reading the tutorial closely enough, as I unintentionally added that to the create page which caused me issues later on that I dind't catch for a hot minute in step 1 of this lab. 


I honestly screwed up a lot while trying to do step two of this lab and I think it made a better computer scientist out of me. I don't really see that many similarities with the Jekyll framework but I also don't remember using Jekyll that much.
