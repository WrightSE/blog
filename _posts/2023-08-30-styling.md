With this post, it marks that I've made a few changes to the styling of my blog. The three changes I made are all pretty simple but make a nice impact on the look of the blog. I changed the background color to a simple sage green, changed the hyper-link color to a sand like color and changed the font of the post headings. I definitely had an interesting time doing this as I ran into an odd error.

![The original blog:]({{ "/assets/images/original-blog-look.PNG" | relative_url }} "old"){: width="500"}

![The new blog:]({{ "/assets/images/new-blog-look-changed.PNG" | relative_url }} "new"){: width="500"}

The weird error that I ran into was one with no actual solution and turned out to have no fix beyond just ignoring it. I assume its due to something with VScode which is what I use to interface with the website creation. Although I was slightly annoyed by there being no real solution to the error, because of it I had the chance to look at a lot of documentation related to Sass; most notably the syntax specific section [here](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax/) and the overall documentation listed [here](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/).

Through my perusal of the documentation trying to figure out that wild error, I found the [import section](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/import/) which was useful later when I imported a font to use on the hyper-links. 

Another problem that I ran into was actually adding the images to this post. This was an issue that I dealt with for at least 3 days on and off, trying everything the stack overflow forums I found had to offer regarding it. Unfortunately none of that worked so I had to set up office hours where I then found that I needed to use the relative_url in Jekyll minima. I doubt that I would've found that on my own in time to turn the assignment so that was a god-send from my professor.
