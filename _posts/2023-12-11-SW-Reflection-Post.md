I think creating a website for our client is a good step towards making the resources that are available through the college more approachable. Being able to view the resources before you ever have to go through with filling out the full form, is a good way to get people interested in what the college has to offer. This can also take out the odd in-between state that exists for some where they aren't certain if the college can even provide that type of resource. Instead, they'll be able to go and check what is available on the website beforehand. 

Though this will make things easier for college students, who can now just look at the list of available textbooks and request one through the site rather than emailing one of the coordinators; it will also make things easier for any community member who needs resources. This is because users are able to store a large amount of personal information, that's needed by the coordinators, with their account at the time that they register. So now, instead of the user having to re-enter all of that information every time that they want to make a request for resources, they'll be able to just fill out the information relating to their current request. 

Users, once they have registered, will also be able to edit their own personal information. This was another bottleneck that existed in the previous system, though on the coordinator's side rather than the user's. Previously, coordinators would have to go through and update the information that they held on a person who was requesting resources and that would sometimes lead to slip ups if names or pronouns had changed. Now, with the user being able to just edit their own information as needed before making a request, the coordinators no longer have to devote as much time or mental energy to it. 

Although none of my core beliefs have been changed by this experience, as they were already fairly in-line with the basis of this project, I greatly appreciated learning about not only the SOAR program at Hendrix but also about how tech can make a difference in resource accessibility. Our client, the head of the SOS program at Hendrix, took great care to discuss with us the rammifications -- both positive and negative -- that our work on this project could have on people. This project was not just a final project, but a pivotal step in the future organization of the program itself. 

This was quite the daunting undertaking and I won't lie, I did feel quite pressured by it. But feeling the gravity of this situation was absolutely necessary, as it wasn't just my grade that I needed to be aware of regarding this. I needed to keep the people that would be using this in mind at every step of the process. Thankfully, I had resources available through our client that laid out ways to approach this and what types of language to use in the creation of our website.  

The largest skill that I think is necessary when trying to bring about social change through these types of projects is your ability to take your client's vision and transform it into a realistic version. It's not to say that the clients had unreasonable wishes for their projects but rather that they instead were asking for a mountain when we were more accurately capable of a mole-hill at this point. The second biggest skill to have in this sort of situation is empathy. Though that seems like it should go without saying, it is 10 times more important when you're working in a situation that deals with sensitive information or situations like some of these projects.

All in all, I think this project was an important part of my liberal arts experience. It allowed me to view the usage of technology to increase acessibilty in a different way. Though I was already aligned with the sort of mindset that promotes this type of project, it was still nice to have this reaffirmed.
