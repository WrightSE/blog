This post marks my first foray into creating SQL schemas using Vertabelo and ERD using LucidChart. Though it isn't necessarily hard to create a database at this point, it is a bit more difficult to read between the lines of the client communication that you're given. The first thing that I created was my ERD, which is displayed below this.

I'm fairly confident in my organization of the ERD because it only has 3 categories. Attributes are easy to figure out, but entities versus relationships are a bit more difficult. The best sort of rule of thumb for entities/relationships that I have is that the relationships require the existence of at least two entities.

The vertabelo schema was quite a bit more difficult for me because of the sheer number of options available.
