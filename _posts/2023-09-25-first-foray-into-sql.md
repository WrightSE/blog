This post marks my first foray into creating SQL schemas using Vertabelo and ERD using LucidChart. Though it isn't necessarily hard to create a database at this point, it is a bit more difficult to read between the lines of the client communication that you're given. The first thing that I created was my ERD, which is displayed below this.
