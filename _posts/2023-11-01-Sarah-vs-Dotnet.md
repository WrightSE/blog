Spoiler alert: This was a major underdog story.

Dotnet destroyed me at about every point in this journey, from the outside it was like watching the first fight in Rocky where he gets absolutely humiliated by his opponent. A majority of my issues ended up being entirely related to dotnet causing issues rather than anything that I was actively causing. 

The easiest part of this entire lab was definitely going through the tutorial. Although I had issues following some of it due to the trailing implied statements, that was more Microsoft's fault than anything. I didn't really notice a difference when it came to working with multiple tables compared to a single one other than the fact that I did forget migrations were a thing for a while which caused me some issues. 

I feel pretty prepared to go work with the database now that I have dealt with multiple tables and managing the multiple levels of scaffolding. A big thing that will end up diverging from this tutorial is that we will need to add in identification and authentication that's based around roles. Though it may just end up being a better solution to restart the database from the identification set up.
