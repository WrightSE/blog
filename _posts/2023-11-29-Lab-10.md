The easiest part of this was definitely just setting up the deployment. Though we ran into some slight issues with getting the connection string values, those were easy enough to fix when we reviewed the sample data that was given.

The SSH terminal step is where we ran into a ton of issues. ./migrate was confusing and definitely tripped us up for quite a bit.

The way that we split up this lab was interesting because we decided to do most of it together on one computer in person. Though we did trade off the individual computer so it was kind of like the 150 lab at points, Amelia was the one who mostly coded this. Choosing to meet up in person was done mostly because it was just the easiest thing for all three of us.
